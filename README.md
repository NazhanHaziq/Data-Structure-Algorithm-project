### Case Study
Previously, in the manual system, the student entries were manually recorded, and the information about the students was transmitted through a different communication channel. Data about the incoming student is entered into a registry. Following the manual system's manual correction, the registered information is checked and removed from the list of students' names on the register. To create a new student number and student number, the previous student number and the current student numbers are manually compared. If someone inquires about the specifics, someone will check another list or register to find out. Finally, every report is manually created and compared to every registry.

The issue was addressed by the development of the Student Management Database System, which simplifies the registration and retrieval process for management. Data about students may now be readily managed by management, saving a lot of time. Given that registration may be completed online, management may find it easier to plan the registrations. The Faculty of Computing at University Malaysia Pahang hosts the Student Management Database System. We will be creating a UMP FKOM Student Management Database System in C language
